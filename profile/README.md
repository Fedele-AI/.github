# ü§ñ Fedele_AI Lab @ Georgia Tech

Welcome to the official GitHub for the AI Lab at Georgia Tech!

- Overseen by: [**Dr. Francesco Fedele**](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/francesco-fedele).
- Head TA: [**Alex Jenkins**](https://alexj.io).

Our lab focuses on cutting-edge research at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, machine learning, signal processing, and artistic expression**,
tackling real-world challenges in engineering and computer science through open source software.

## üî¨ Research Areas  
We explore a variety of topics, including:  
- **Generative AI & Creativity** ‚Äì Investigating AI‚Äôs role in artistic and scientific creativity, including AI-generated art, music, and literature.  
- **Multimodal AI** ‚Äì Developing models/software that integrate and process multiple data types, such as text, images, audio, and video.  
- **AI Art** ‚Äì Exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative expression through deep learning and neural networks.  
- **AI Education** ‚Äì Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to develop interactive educational resources for teaching AI concepts and applications.
- **Brainwaves, Art, and AI** ‚Äì Studying how brain-computer interfaces and neurofeedback can influence AI-generated artistic creations.
